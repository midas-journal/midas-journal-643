  abstract = {Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides a powerful
	tool for mapping neural histoarchitecture in vivo. However, DTI can
	only resolve a single fiber orientation within each imaging voxel
	due to the constraints of the tensor model. For example, DTI cannot
	resolve fibers crossing, bending, or twisting within an individual
	voxel. Intravoxel fiber crossing can be resolved using q-space diffusion
	imaging, but q-space imaging requires large pulsed field gradients
	and time-intensive sampling. It is also possible to resolve intravoxel
	fiber crossing using mixture model decomposition of the high angular
	resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) signal, but mixture modeling
	requires a model of the underlying diffusion process.Recently, it
	has been shown that the HARDI signal can be reconstructed model-independently
	using a spherical tomographic inversion called the Funk-Radon transform,
	also known as the spherical Radon transform. The resulting imaging
	method, termed q-ball imaging, can resolve multiple intravoxel fiber
	orientations and does not require any assumptions on the diffusion
	process such as Gaussianity or multi-Gaussianity. The present paper
	reviews the theory of q-ball imaging and describes a simple linear
	matrix formulation for the q-ball reconstruction based on spherical
	radial basis function interpolation. Open aspects of the q-ball reconstruction
	algorithm are discussed.},

  abstract = {The complex structural organization of the white matter of the brain
	can be depicted in vivo in great detail with advanced diffusion magnetic
	resonance (MR) imaging schemes. Diffusion MR imaging techniques are
	increasingly varied, from the simplest and most commonly used technique-the
	mapping of apparent diffusion coefficient values-to the more complex,
	such as diffusion tensor imaging, q-ball imaging, diffusion spectrum
	imaging, and tractography. The type of structural information obtained
	differs according to the technique used. To fully understand how
	diffusion MR imaging works, it is helpful to be familiar with the
	physical principles of water diffusion in the brain and the conceptual
	basis of each imaging technique. Knowledge of the technique-specific
	requirements with regard to hardware and acquisition time, as well
	as the advantages, limitations, and potential interpretation pitfalls
	of each technique, is especially useful.},
